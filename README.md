# CS120Week3
Firstly, each member of the group should create a GitHub account, please use a name that allows you to be readily identified (no obscure or cryptic aliases).

Your task is to work together as a team to create the design of a small basic website with at least 6 pages. This should be built in at least two stages such that you have an initial project which is forked to produce a development branch (for the second stage of development where you might add new functionality to your web pages) and then subsequently merged back into the original branch.

The subject and content of the website are left to your discretion. You should create a public Github respository for this project and work collaboratively on the project.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WRITE ANY CODE, THE FILES THAT YOU COLLABORATE ON ONLY NEED TO BE TEXT FILES GIVING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED WEBSITE.

You should connect to the Git Hub repository using either IntelliJ (ITSD & DTSP students) or PyCharm (ITMB students). You may be asked by your tutor to show that you have done this during the week 4 mandatory day.

You should organise your project in order that you can demonstrate that everyone has contributed code (for at least one initial and one updated page) to the project.

You must fully document the development of the project with a particular emphasis on how you collaborated using Github.

What to submit :
Each individual member of the group should submit a word document consisting of three sections:
1. A link to the public Github repository for your project

2. A group statement on the development of the project and the use of Github to collaborate (this statement should be 200 words and be both contributed to and agreed upon by all members of the team)

3. An individual reflective report on the collaborative project. This should be 400 words in length and should include reflective commentary on your role in the project, evidence (screenshots from IntelliJ/Pycharm and Github) of your contribution to the project and a critical evaluation of the effectivenss of the team and the utility offered by the Github version control system


GROUP STATMENT draft

We successfully completed the task. we all added a text document or two to the initial branch to describe the basics of the webpage, 
then after all the pages had been created we created a new branch called the development branch, on which we all made changes to the pages before merging it back into the main
