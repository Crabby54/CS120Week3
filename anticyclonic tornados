This is a fun fact about tornadoes
Did you know:

Tornadoes can create “anticyclonic tornadoes” that spin in the opposite direction
In the Northern Hemisphere, most tornadoes turn in a counterclockwise direction, and in the Southern Hemisphere, they go
clockwise. Anticyclonic tornadoes take the opposite direction, and this affects only 2% of the tornadoes in the area.
These tend to be smaller and weaker than cyclonic tornadoes.
